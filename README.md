## NCAA Women's Basketball Championships

This Tableau visualization, inspired by [CJ Mayes](https://x.com/_CJMayes), shows the history of the NCAA women's basketball tournament from 1982-2024. Each dot on the outside represents a year and each circle on the inside represents a team. The lines connect the teams to the years they have won. Hovering over a line reveals details including Team, Year, Opponent, Score, Coach, and Location of the game.
